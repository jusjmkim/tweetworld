- Node’s non blocking I/O to use the Twitter Streaming API in real time
- Socket.io to maintain an open connection between server and client
- Express framework to create the server’s routes
- PostgreSQL database via the Sequelize ORM

Make a pull request if you're interested in helping develop for this project.

## Future

We'd love to analyze tweet statistics by country to see trending hashtags. We also want to use a translation API to display tweets in languages selected by the user.
